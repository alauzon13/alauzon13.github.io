## About me
I'm a current graduate student in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, interested in understanding how data informs news, policy, and the public opinion. In between finishing my Honours Bachelor's of Science in Statistics from the University of Toronto and my Master's degree, I worked as a Statistician at [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en). This website hosts projects I've completed across my undergraduate and graduate studies -- the homepage of each project will indicate whether it was done for a course, paid research, or was a personal undertaking.
