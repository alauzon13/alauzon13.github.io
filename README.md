## About me
I'm a current graduate student in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, interested in understanding how data informs news, policy, and the public opinion. In between finishing my Honours Bachelor's of Science in Statistics from the University of Toronto and my Master's degree, I was as a Statistician at [Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en), working on a suite of agriculture surveys. This website hosts projects I've completed across my undergraduate and graduate studies. Some are finished, some are still in progress -- I'm often retunring to old projects with new ideas. The homepage of each project will reflect its status, as well as whether it was done for a course, paid research, or was a personal undertaking.
