## Dupe Detection: Can a machine learning model spot the fake? 

### About this project 
This was a project I completed independently, not as part of any class or research position. I had been seeing some buzz on the internet around "dupes", or replicas, of designer products, specifically handbags. Handbag replicas have gotten so popular and so close to the originals that sellers with authenticity guarantees (like The Real Real) have been caught selling them. I was curious if a machine learning model would be able to spot differences between real and replicated handbags that consumers could not, based on stock photos. I chose this use case not only because of my interest in ethical fashion consumption, but also because I thought the results would be interesting either way. If the model was able to correctly identify real versus fake handbags, then perhaps the accidental sales of replica handbags from retailers believing they had the real thing could be mitigated. If the model failed, maybe that means in terms of photographs, the dupes have truly become indiscernable from the originals. Spoiler: the model was, in fact, *terrible*.
