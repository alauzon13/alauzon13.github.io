## Analyzing Characteristics of Mass Shootings in the USA, 1966-2021

### About this project 
Having lived in the US through Sandy Hook, Parkland, Uvalde, and Santa Fe shootings -- 2 of which were in Texas, my home state of 10 years -- mass shootings and gun control were always a topic of discussion. When I had the opportunity to pick a dataset for a final project in my second year of undergrad, I knew I wanted to spend some time to approach this topic from an analytical standpoint. Combining two mass shooting datasets and applying topics covered in the course, I found that shootings were equally probable throughout the week, mass shooters are most likely to be in their late 20s-early 30s, and there are between 5-6 deaths on average per mass shooting incident. 

### Skills
