## About this project 
This was the final project for Applied Statistics II course, completed in the second term of my Master's degree. We were tasked with finding a dataset and implementing some of the supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms covered in the course. My group and I decided to challenge ourselves by picking a data from a field which we knew next to nothing about -- baseball. 

My responsibilities were to implement spectral clustering on the batted ball location, and to predict player performance using principal component analysis and extreme gradient boosting. All group members contributed to the writing of the report. 

I worked on this project with Navena Ciganovic and Joanna Lo.
