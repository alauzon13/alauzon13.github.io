## Teaching Multiverse Analysis through an Interactive Web App

### About this project 
I completed this project as part of the Summer Undergraduate Data Science (SUDS) program at the University of Toronto's Data Sciences Institute, supervised by Dr. Nathan Taback. Students accepted into this program are paid to complete a data science project over the course of the summer, culminating in a poster fair. 

I think a lot about statistical pedagogy -- statistics is a unique discipline in that students from a wide range of fields encounter an introductory statistics course at some point. Everyone has to take statistics, yet everyone hates statistics. Well, obviously not everyone, but when I tell people what I study, I often receive some combination of raised eyebrows, a concerned exhale, or a confession that Stats 101 was their least favorite course. Doing this project allowed me to dive into the pedagogical research about statistics and to play professor for a summer.
