## Census-Independent Population Estimation in the Yukon

### About this project 
This is a supervised research project I am completing as part of my Master's degree (my program's version of a thesis). I received a Canada Graduate Scholarship from the National Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to complete this work, valued at $27,000CAD. I am supervised by Dr. Monica Alexander, a leader in the population estimation/demographic statistics field. 

I first began to think critically about the census during a course about ethics in computing, where we learned about how the census was one of the earliest examples of data collection as a political tool. Through my independent research, I was surprised to learn that in remote northern communities where there may not be reliable internet access, Statistics Canada goes door-to-door to manually gather data. Further, because these communities are more migratory, population estimates can quickly become outdated between census periods. Some communities are also ice-road access only, and are becoming harder to reliably reach during collection times. 

Given these challenges, nonresponse rates in the Territories are the highest in the country. Though statistical methods like imputation are used to calculate the estimates, there are no measures of uncerainty published in census reports. This led me to wonder if census-independent population estimation work, which is often done in areas where conducting a census isn't possible, could be applied to the Canadian context. 

I am developing a pipeline to produce population estimates of the Yukon Territory using community-generated mappying data from Open Street Map and Landsat Satellite imagery. This is an ongoing project that I will continue to work on until September. The status will be updated below. Preliminary materials are available to view in the links provided. 

**Current status (updated June 9, 2025)**: RF model using mapping data complete. Satellite data ready for analysis. Next steps: cleaning satellite data + running RF model, creating ensemble model.
