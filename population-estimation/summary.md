## Census-Independent Population Estimation in the Yukon

### About this project 
This is a supervised research project I am completing as part of my Master's degree (my program's version of a thesis). I became interested in the Census in my fourth year of undergrad during a computer science class titled "Computers and Society". One of our modules was about the politics of data, and specifically centered on how data collection, organization, and use are based on historical and political judgements, and how the census was one of the earliest examples of data collection as a political tool. This inspired me to look into the Canadian census more deeply, where I learned about the many unique obstacles Canada faces in administering a census due to our population patterns and geographic features. 

I was surprised to learn that in remote northern communities where there may not be reliable internet access, Statistics Canada goes door-to-door to manually gather data. Further, these northern communities tend to be more migratory, so information can quickly become outdated between census periods, and communities that are ice-road access only are becoming harder to reliably reach. I became interested in population estimation strategies in areas where doing a census is not feasible, and whether these tools could be applied to the Canadian context. 

Supervised by Dr. Monica Alexander, my project is specifically about predicting population in the Yukon using community generated mapping data from Open Street Map and satellite imagery. This work is ongoing,
