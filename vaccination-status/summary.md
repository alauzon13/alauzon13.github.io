## Vaccination Status and Voting Intentions, 2022 Texas State Elections 

### About this project 
This was a final project for an observational data course in my third year of undergrad. Having gone to middle and high school in Houston, Texas, I vote in state elections and followed politics closely when I lived there. 
The 2022 gubernatorial election was the first since the onset of the pandemic and was projected to be a tight race between Republican incumbent Greg Abbott and Democrat Beto O'Rourke. 
Using data from the Texas Politics Project (University of Texas), I employed propensity score matching to investigate a causal relationship between vaccination status and voting intention. 
My results indicated that being vaccinated did have a negative causal relationship with voting for Abbott.
