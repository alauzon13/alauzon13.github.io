        <div class="step" data-step="1">After centuries of exploitation, misrepresentation, and lack of stewardship,
            there has been a growing global effort for Indigenous Peoples to reclaim their
           Knowledges and data.</div>
         <div class="step" data-step="2"> The path to <b>Indigenous Data Sovereignty</b> involves First Nations, Inuit, and
           Métis peoples owning and controlling data that is created with or about them. Under this framework,
           Indigenous Peoples move beyond the roles of participant or subject into the roles of partner and
           co-researcher. </div>
         <div class="step" data-step="3"> Indigenous Data Sovereignty is even more crucial in circumstances where 
           Western and Indigenous knowledge systems have opposing records of the same events -- exemplified by the 
           Western rejection of traditional Haudenosaunee Wampum Belts as a valid
           data source. The dynamic, relational nature of the Wampum Belt is an important
           example of Indigenous Data Sovereignty in practice, and how it can be used to create more resilient
           data systems.</div>
         <div class="step" data-step="4">
           <h2>Indigenous and Western Knowledge Systems</h2>
           In the Western worldview, knowledge is gained through observation and experimentation. 
           Western knowledge is produced in specific, controlled environments, yet also
           hinges upon generalizability to other contexts. Western ways of knowing also reinforce the idea
           that knowledge obtained outside this experimental framework is less valid.</div>
         <div class="step" data-step="5">On the other hand, Indigenous Knowledge is informed by 
           <a href="https://bcmj.org/articles/two-eyed-seeing-current-approaches-and-discussion-medical-applications">land and the environment.</a>
           Indigenous approaches to research are varied, but often include a relational element -- acounting for experiences
           and spirituality. Indigenous data exists in diverse forms --
           regalia, songs, art, ceremonies, oral traditions, etc. -- and a critical part of Indigenous Data
           Sovereignty is accepting data that exists outside of Western definitions and parameters. While frameworks like 
           <a href="https://bcmj.org/articles/two-eyed-seeing-current-approaches-and-discussion-medical-applications">Two Eyed Seeing</a> work to 
           hold these worldviews in tandem, there are still instances where Indigenous and Western knowledge systems 
           maintain different records of the same events. 
           One data source that has been met with particular
           Western scrutiny has been the Haudenosaunee Wampum Belts.</div>
           <div class="step" data-step="6">
             <h2>The Two-Row Wampum</h2>
             <b>Wampum belts</b> are intricate beaded artworks made out of shells, and are thought of as a
           living record of the Haudenosaunee nation. Wampum can symbolise many
           different events, from titles, technological innovations, treaties, and much more. The belts are
           often used as a guide to share oral traditions or as part of public demonstrations.</div>
           <div class="step" data-step="7">
             One of the most famous Wampum Belts is the Two Row Wampum, or Kaswentha
           (Gaswéñdah), representing a treaty of "respectful coexistence" between the Haudenosaunee and the Dutch in 1613. This
           Wampum is made from purple quahog shells and white whelk snail shells, and depicts two
           purple horizontal lines. One purple line represents the Haudeonsaunee canoe, and the other the
           Dutch tall ship. Between the purple lines is a row of white shells representing the River of Life,
           upon which the canoe and tall ship are both travelling. The two purple rows run in parallel, never
           crossing or intersecting -- both communities were to maintain sovereignty as well as
           interdependence.</div>
         <div class="step" data-step="8">At the time of the treaty’s inception, the Haudenosaunee did not use paper to record their
           history. Because there is no original paper-based documentation of the treaty, some Western scholars question 
           its legitimacy. Wampum Belts and their
           accompanying oral histories exist outside the Western constraints of what data can be, and as a
           result are often dismissed entirely.</div>
           <div class="step" data-step="9">
             <h2>The Resilience of Alternative Data Storage</h2>
             Wampum Belts form a resilient data system unlike any Western method. After Chief
           Deskaheh toured Europe to garner global support for Haudenosaunee sovereignty in 1923, the
           Canadian government ordered the RCMP to overthrow the Confederacy and <b>destroy</b> the
           Wampum Belts. </div>
           <div class="step" data-step="10">However, Wampum Belts and their
           accompanying oral histories are a <b>living, dynamic database</b> -- meaning that destruction did not
           result in missing data. With the help of Indigenous Knowledge Holders, the belts were able to be
           remade and the database persists. Wampum Belts do not store data in a server or a spreadsheet,
           but instead store information in the community.</div>
         <div class="step" data-step="11">The relational nature of the Wampum system epitomises the Indigenous
           worldview of knowledge creation and sharing. Given how ruinous colonial forces were and are,
           we must consider that the Indigenous worldview and data methods like the Wampum Belt may
           be more resilient than Western methods. As such, the Wampum Belt system exemplifies the
           necessity of Indigenous Data Sovereignty. Further, the system elucidates that it is crucial for
           Western scholars to be open-minded when exploring different data sources. Whether it be from
           Indigenous communities or other backgrounds, there is no one way to gather information.</div>
         <div class="step" data-step="12">Perhaps the best methods lie at the intersection of two worldviews.</div>
