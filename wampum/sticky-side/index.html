        <div class="step" data-step="1">
       
          <p>After centuries of exploitation, misrepresentation, and exclusion from stewardship, Indigenous Peoples from across North America are working to reclaim their data.</p>
              
          <p>Data has long been weaponized against Indigenous peoples. Early census data was used to justify forceful assimilation policies, like the Indian Act in Canada; the lack of race- or ethnicity-disaggregated law enforcement data has allowed for the crisis of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/why-indigenous-people-are-fighting-for-data-sovereignty-1.7158508">Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women</a> to become invisible; regular destruction of 
          <a href="https://windspeaker.com/news/windspeaker-news/indigenous-data-sovereignty-concerns-raised-harm-residential-schools">residential school records</a>has obscured information about how many children died in this system.</p>  
              
          <p>Just to name a few.</p>
              
          <p>Now, it's time for Indigenous Peoples to be in charge of their own data.</p>
              
   
              </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="2">
              <h2>Indigenous Data Sovereignty</h2>

              The path to <b>Indigenous Data Sovereignty</b> involves First Nations, Inuit, and
              Métis peoples owning and controlling data that is created with or about them. It's about Indigenous Peoples moving from subjects to researchers. 
            It's about accepting Indigenous data, in its various forms, as equally valid as Western knowledge. 
              </div>
            
        <div class="step" data-step="3"> <p>Prioritizing Indigenous Data Sovereignty is crucial when Western and Indigenous knowledge systems 
            have opposing records of the same events, as is often the case when it comes to treaties.</p> 
            
           <p> While many treaty disputes have centered on Indigenous records stored through oral tradition (the <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sylliboy-case">Syliboy case</a>, 1928; the <a href = "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/marshall-case">Marshall Case</a>, 1993), 
            the Haudenosaunee Wampum Belts are a unique example of how oral history and Indigenous artistry intersect as a means of recordkeeping. 
            Despite Western rejection of the Wampum Belts as a valid record of a treaty made between the Haudenosaunee and the Dutch in 1613, the dynamic, relational, 
            resilient nature of this data system is an important example of Indigenous Data Sovereignty in practice.</div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
              <h2>Indigenous and Western Knowledge Systems</h2>
              In the Western worldview, knowledge is gained through observation and experimentation. 
              Western knowledge is produced in specific, controlled environments, yet also
              hinges upon generalizability to other contexts. Western ways of knowing also reinforce the idea
              that knowledge obtained outside this experimental framework is less valid.</div>
        <div class="step" data-step="5"> 
          <p>On the other hand, Indigenous Knowledge is informed by <a href="https://bcmj.org/articles/two-eyed-seeing-current-approaches-and-discussion-medical-applications">land and the environment.</a> Indigenous approaches to research are varied, but often include a relational element -- accounting for experiences
              and spirituality. Indigenous data exists in diverse forms, including regalia, songs, art, ceremonies, and oral traditions. A critical part of Indigenous Data
              Sovereignty is recognizing and respecting data that exists outside of Western definitions and parameters.</p> 
              
              <p>While frameworks like  <a href="https://bcmj.org/articles/two-eyed-seeing-current-approaches-and-discussion-medical-applications">Two Eyed Seeing</a> work to 
              hold these worldviews in tandem, there are still instances where Indigenous and Western knowledge systems maintain different records of the same events.</p>  
             </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="6">
                <h2>The Two-Row Wampum</h2>
                <b>Wampum belts</b> are intricate beaded artworks made out of shells, and are thought of as a
              living record of the Haudenosaunee nation (present-day New York State and Ontario). Wampum can symbolize many types of events — 
              including the granting of titles, technological innovations, treaties, and more. The belts are
              often used as a guide to share oral traditions or as part of public demonstrations.</div>
        <div class="step" data-step="7">
                <figure class = "jpg">
                  <img src="../two-row-wampum.jpg" alt="two-row-wampum" style="width:120%; height:auto;">
                  <figcaption> <a href = https://www.onondaganation.org/culture/wampum/two-row-wampum-belt-guswenta/"> The Two Row Wampum</a></figcaption>
              </figure>
                
              <p>One of the most famous Wampum Belts is the Two Row Wampum, or Kaswentha (Gaswéñdah), representing a treaty of "respectful coexistence" between the Haudenosaunee and the Dutch in 1613. 
                  When Dutch settlers first arrived on Haudenosaunee land and suggested that Indigenous Peoples refer to them as “father,” the
                Haudenosaunee proposed “brother” instead. This autonomy and sovereignty is reflected in the design of the belt,
                made from purple quahog shells and white whelk snail shells, displaying two horizontal lines.</p> 
                
                <p>One purple line represents the Haudeonsaunee canoe, and the other the
                  Dutch tall ship. Between the purple lines is a row of white shells representing the River of Life,
                  upon which the canoe and tall ship are both travelling, neither steering nor crossing the other. </p></div>
        <div class="step" data-step="8">At the time of the treaty’s inception, the Haudenosaunee did not use paper to record their
              history. Because there is no original paper-based documentation of the treaty, some Western scholars question 
              its legitimacy. Wampum Belts and their accompanying oral histories exist outside the Western constraints of what data can be, and as a
              result are often dismissed entirely.</div>
        <div class="step" data-step="9">
                <h2>The Resilience of Alternative Data Storage</h2>
                Wampum Belts form a resilient data system unlike any Western method. After Chief
              Deskaheh toured Europe to garner global support for Haudenosaunee sovereignty in 1923, the
              Canadian government ordered the RCMP to dismantle the Confederacy and <b> destroy </b> the Wampum Belts. </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="10">However, Wampum Belts and their
              accompanying oral histories are a <b> living, dynamic database </b> -- meaning that destruction did not
              result in missing data. With the guidance of Indigenous Knowledge Holders, the belts were
              remade and the database persists. Wampum Belts do not store data in a server or a spreadsheet,
              but instead store information in the community.</div>
        <div class="step" data-step="11">The relational nature of the Wampum system epitomises the Indigenous
              worldview of knowledge creation and sharing. Given how destructive colonial forces were and are,
              we must consider that the Indigenous worldview and data methods like the Wampum Belt may
              be more resilient than the Western counterparts. </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="12"> Scientific research has expanded to accept not just spreadsheets and tables as data, but images, videos, 
            novels, audio, and much more as valid sources of information. The Wampum system is an invitation to expand our
            understanding of data even further, and to challenge Western beliefs around what "good" data looks like.  </div>
