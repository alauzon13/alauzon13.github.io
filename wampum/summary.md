## About this project 
This was a paid research project I undertook as part of the Ethics in Statistics Research Cohort (2023), supervised by Dr. Liza Bolton. We were given free reign to create any final product we wanted, as long as it was relevant to ethics in statistics. I took the opportunity to dive into Indigenous Data Sovereignty, a topic I had been interested in for a while but hadn't been able to study in classes. My research paper specifically highlighted the Haudenosaunee Wampum Belt as an example of when Indigenous Knowledges provide a more resilient data system than Western methods. 

The original project was just a paper, but I returned to it recently to update the information and add a Scrollytelling element using HTML.
