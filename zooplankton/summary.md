## Classifying Zooplankton

### About this project 
Over four months, I worked on this project as part of my "Data Science Methods, Collaboration, and Communication" course. 
In this class, students work as consultants, collaborating with external scientists to fulfill some data science needs. 
With the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, I developed a machine learning model to classify images of Zooplankton in Lake Huron. 
The [Final Report](Zooplankton_Final_Report.pdf) was the main deliverable for this course, but since completing that I have written up the [Project Overview](overview.md) to be a more high-level account of my work. 

This project was supervised by Dr. Vianey Leos Barajas and Dr. Sofia Ruiz Suarez. 

### Skills
Python/Scikit-learn (transfer learning, neural network development, ensemble model development), project management
